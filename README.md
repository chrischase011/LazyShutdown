# LazyShutdown
If you are too lazy to shutdown your laptop, this script is for you.

Sometimes, windows PC/Laptop is too slow to respond when you want to shutdown your PC/Laptop
on by clicking Start button. 

With this script, you can automatically shutdown your PC/Laptop with just one click.

Or if you are just too lazy to shutdown your PC/Laptop like me. :D
